External Sorting Implementation for Ordering Massive Files

Based on KMerge algorithm


External sorting is a term for a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive
amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into
the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the
slower external memory (usually a hard drive).
